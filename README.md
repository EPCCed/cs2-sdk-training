# Introductory training course for CS-2 SDK programming

This repository contains the materials for a practical introduction to using the Cerebras SDK for programming the Cerebras CS-2 system. If you are participating in one of our organised tutorials then all the required tools will be preinstalled on the CS-2 system for you to use as part of the session. 

This top level directory contains:
* [lectures](lectures) which holds the PDF lecture material for the course, providing an overview to the system architecture and practical walkthroughs
* [practicals](practicals) contains the practical walkthrough material (that we will do together) and the handson activities that are more independent

## Tutorial timetable
